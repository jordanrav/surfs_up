##Overview of the analysis
The point of this project is to get the summary statistics of two months in the year to see if a surf shop/ice cream shop would be a sustainable business for year round.

##Results
* based on the two tables below, the mean temp for June is 74, while the mean temp for Dec. is 71 degrees, this would suggest that June is warmer than December which would make June better for the business.
*The Standard Deviation for June is about 3.257 while the one for december is about 3.745, this would suggest that June is more consistent in temperature compared to December but overall it does not vary too much. this is beneficial for running a surf/ice cream shop year round because the temperature will be predicatable year round.
* The minimum temperature for June is 64 while the one for december is 56. the max for June is 85 while the one for december is 83. this would suggest that June would probably be best for the ice cream side of business for the shop but that since december sometimes reaches the 80s that it could also work december meaning that it could most likely work year round.

## Summary
Even though there mean temperatures are different (albeit by only 3 degrees), I believe that the temperatures for December and June suggest that the Surf/Ice cream shop business can be a sustainable business year round. the max and mean temperatures in december make it seem as if it can be hot enough for the business to be sustainable in the winter months. There are two different queries I would like to perform to gain more data. First, I would like to see the same two months temperature data for the past 10-20 years to collect a better average of what the temperature is around that time of year. the second query I would like to do is measure the percipitation data of these two months to see how often it rains, which may affect the success of a surf/ice cream shop during those months.
